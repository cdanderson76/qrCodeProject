I think that the key for me to complete this project was using Figma to get the actual dimensions for the card.  With this, I think I was able to code the project more accurately.  The first time I tried this, I didn't have the dimensions and wasn't using Figma, so I found it to be a really big help once I started using it.

Second, I feel like I struggled a little with positioning containers using Flexbox.  I'm still trying to get comfortable with CSS Grid, and as I continue to work on those skills, I feel like I will slowly start to implement it.  But until then, I'm fairly comfortable using Flexbox to complete projects.  Outside of that, as I stated before, once I had the dimensions for this project, the tougher part was just positioning the containers and making sure that everything was aligned properly.
